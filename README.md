This repository contains a prototype machine learning model developed by the Mathemedics 2000 team. The model leverages linear regression to analyze the Pima Indian diabetes dataset provided by the Indian government. The primary function of this model is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on their medical report, using binary comparisons.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Model**: Utilizes linear regression for prediction.
- **Binary Comparison**: Provides a binary output indicating diabetes presence.
- **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**: Uses a well-known dataset from the Indian government.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhaabhijeet864/Prototype_Diabetes_Model.git
   cd Prototype_Diabetes_Model
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Prepare the dataset**

   Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory as mentioned in the dataset section.

2. **Run the training script**

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This script will train the model on the Pima Indian diabetes dataset.

### Making Predictions

1. **Use the trained model**

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input <path_to_input_file>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_input_file>` with the path to the file containing the patient's medical report.

### Example

Here is an example of how to make a prediction:

```bash
python predict.py --input sample_patient_data.csv
```

The output will indicate whether the patient has diabetes or not based on the provided medical report.

## Dataset

The Pima Indian diabetes dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). Ensure to place the dataset in the `data` directory of this repository.
